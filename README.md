# BitcoinPublicKeyGrabber
A python program that finds the public keys to a list of bitcoin addresses if they are known.


# Usage
Simply place the bitcoin addresses you want to look up in the addresses.csv file, one address per line and then run the python script, I use Jupyter Notebook to run the program.
 
 I put 10 known bitcoin addresses from the richlist into addresses.csv for example data.
