# Usage
Simply place the bitcoin addresses you want to look up in the addresses.csv file, one address per line and then run the python script, I use Jupyter Notebook to run the program. The program will output the public keys to txt file called pubkeys.txt.
 
 I put 10 known bitcoin addresses from the richlist into addresses.csv for example data.
